                  Who would've thought that i would write a love letter for someone, when i would usually do it for someone else's lover, now i am making one for my own? i have never felt this much pressure to write one for you, I'd brag to others that i can write a letter within few minutes but this one took few days to finish.

                            love has never been in my mind ever since it has tore my heart a lot of times, and i have given up the thought of falling in love again. only fools would fall in love is what i always say to myself. who would've thought that i would be pointing at my own face telling I'm a fool? it's ironic that have said that i have kicked out love from my life, that i don't have anything to do with it but look at me now? giggling, blushing, and smiling over a girl that i thought would only be a temporary feeling.sixth of November was the first day we talked, who would've thought I'd celebrated fourteen of February with you?

                             ever since you came into my life, everything felt so easy and light. it felt like a huge burden on my shoulder was lifted up. i never expected that i would like you this much, when i was telling myself that i would only see you as a friend. you have made me realized that i was still capable of loving someone, and i was loved by someone like you.

                            i am still learning every day, and i am changing too, well not only for me but for the both of us. we both have our shortcomings, but i pray that we can still make it work. I'm still trying to understand you, and adjusting. please be patient with me too.

                            i once prayed to God to give me a love that only i can see on movies, it seemed really impossible but i really prayed for it then it gave me you. i am still guarding my heart though, am i ready to gamble everything in this love? will you be an answered prayers, or lesson learnt? all i pray for now is for it to be you for a lifetime, because if it's not you then i don't want to believe in love anymore. even though we are far from each other, i only pray for that our love will always stay. I am choosing you, every day, and i am choosing us always and forever.
